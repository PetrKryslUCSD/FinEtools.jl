# FinEtools: Finite Element tools in Julia

`FinEtools` is a package for basic operations on finite element meshes: Construction, modification, selection, and evaluation of quantities defined on a mesh. Utilities are provided for maintaining mesh-based data (fields), for defining normals and loads, for working with physical units and coordinate systems, and for integrating over finite element meshes. ![Alt Visualization of acoustic pressure](http://hogwarts.ucsd.edu/~pkrysl/site.images/baffled-piston-aa.png "FinEtools.jl")

The package supports application packages, for instance:

- [Meshing](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsMeshing.jl);
- [Meshing of biomedical images](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsVoxelMesher.jl);
- [Linear acoustics](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsAcoustics.jl);
- [Heat conduction](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsHeatDiff.jl);
- [Linear stress analysis](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsDeforLinear.jl);
- [Nonlinear stress analysis](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsDeforNonlinear.jl);
- [Nonlinear analysis of flexible beam structures](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsFlexBeams.jl);
- [Vibration in fluids](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsVibInFluids.jl).

# FinEtools: Finite Element tools in Julia

`FinEtools` is a package for basic operations on finite element meshes: Construction, modification, selection, and evaluation of quantities defined on a mesh. Utilities are provided for maintaining mesh-based data (fields), for defining normals and loads, for working with physical units and coordinate systems, and for integrating over finite element meshes.

## Get FinEtools

This package is  registered, and hence one can do just
```julia
] add FinEtools
```
Only version 1.x and the nightly builds of Julia are supported. The best bet is the latest stable Julia.

## Testing

```julia
] test FinEtools
```

## Usage and Documentation

Tutorials in the form
of marked-down Julia source files using the
[Literate](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) workflow are available
and more will  be added in the near future. Each application package has some tutorials. For a complete list refer to [the search](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD?tab=repositories&q=FinEtools+Tutorial&type=&language=).

The package has been used to build applications for various purposes. For a complete list refer to [the search](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD?tab=repositories&q=FinEtools&type=&language=).

The documentation  is published as [Github pages](https://petrkryslucsd.github.io/FinEtools.jl/latest/).

- 08/09/2018: The toolkit is at this point compatible with Julia 1.0.0 in that
the tests are almost 100% passing. A handful of tests however are failing on Appveyor/Travis because of some LLVM issues, and these are at the moment left out of the test suite.
- 06/08/2018: FinEtools is now a registered package. The release 0.3.0 works with Julia 0.7.0-alpha. The notebook examples still need updating for 0.7.

- 03/20/2018: FinEtools version to be used with Julia 0.7 and above is at the moment being developed in a separate branch,
path_to_0.7. At this point the package runs and tests cleanly with 0.7.
- 12/10/2017: A use-case package explaining how to integrate FinEtools with  the user's own code is [available here](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsUseCase).

- 10/12/2017: Evaluation of global error norms implemented.

- 07/23/2017: Export of the finite element model to Abaqus  CAE (from Daussault Systems) has been implemented. The FinEtools package can of course  handle the finite element calculations that the export enables, but the point is to have an independent verification of the results. Export of continuum-element meshes for  vibration and static stress analysis  is currently included.
